I'm a multidisciplinary product designer for Mobile and Web applications. I've spent 8 years as a Quality Assurance Engineer for music applications, fighting for the user experience (One of which inludes Apple's 2013 iPad App of the Year). Since 2013, I have shifted my focus onto *designing* a great User Experience. 

With combined business knowledge gained while building 2 startups, my multidisciplinary computing-arts degree, and experience in the tech space, I am equipped to improve your existing UX and UI design, or create and transform your ideas into beautifully visible, tangible, and testable designs and prototypes, ready for development, or manage the development process all the way through to deployment.
