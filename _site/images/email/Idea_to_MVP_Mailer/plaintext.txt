Hi,

I am contacting you in regards to your search for a UI/UX specialist.
Please take a look at my portfolio @ williamharveydesigns.com.

Iâ€™m based in California. I have an Interdisciplinary Computing-Arts degree from UCSD. 10 years in Tech, one of the projects I was on won 2013 iPad App of the year, awarded by Apple. Now for the last 3 years, I am aiming to provide User-Centric business solutions with modern aesthetics as a UI/UX/Branding design consultant, with focus on Mobile and Web Software. My skills range from logo design, branding, user-flow mapping, wire-framing, to a code-ready design specification, to fully functioning animated prototypes, to a fully managed product launch.

All of my services include complimentary support post-handoff, to ensure the project remains on a path of the highest quality.
Let me know when you have 20 minutes to spare. I would love to get on the phone, learn more about your project, clarify your business goals and the issues you would like to solve, and get started on a strategy session. I look forward to hearing from you :)

In the meantime, you may find this article helpful to Get You From App Idea to MVP.
