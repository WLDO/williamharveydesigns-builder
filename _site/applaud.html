<h3 id="section_title">The Challenge</h3>
<p class="content__item-left">
Appluad was my very first solo design project. What started in 2011 led me to the path I am on today. The goal was to provide a system that allowed people in an audience to discover and purchase music played in a public space via a DJ, Band, or any Performing Artist. Fans should be able to view nearby event information and information about the music currently playing at that event. The track information will always be correct, because the artist is connected to the system too!
The biggest Design Challenge was to give the user the most important information first, then make the process as swift and painless as possible.
</p>

<h3 id="section_title">Solution</h3>
<p class="content__item-left">
My main goal was to show the Exact Title and Artist of the song the Band or DJ is currently playing immediately! So the first step was to simplify the screen space by only providing the most important info first, then allow the user to explore the app second. I provided a great big button in the center of the screen, that was all about the current song playing.
</p>

<p><img class="content__item-img-center animated zoomIn" src="/images/applaud/applaud-3.png" alt="Applaud for iPhone" /></p>
<p class="content__item-left">
I sectioned the screen into three separate parts: The Event, the Current Song, and the Past Songs. Users can explore, instantly save songs onto their music library, then play songs later, reminding the user of that moment they heard the song for the first time.
</p>

<p><img class="content__item-img-center animated zoomIn" src="/images/applaud/applaud-4.png" alt="Applaud for iPhone" /></p>
<p class="content__item-left">
The system is also connected to an online music store! We allow any artist to upload their music to our store. This way artists can finish making a song in the evening and begin selling it at their gig by night. They can even spread the new song to other DJs to play that night. Fans have the option to purchase the music being played. They can purchase the track from our store or search for the track in Spotify, Soundcloud, iTunes, or other online stores.
</p>

<p><img class="content__item-img-center animated zoomIn" src="/images/applaud/applaud-5.png" alt="Applaud for iPhone" /></p>
<p class="content__item-left">
The user can find live events closest to them, discover upcoming events near them, see track-lists of past events. They can also search to see where else tracks have been played, find out what Djs are playing their favorite tracks, or find out where their favorite artist are playing next.
</p>

<p class="content__item-left">
Artists get rewarded for every sale made through Applaud. If a performing artist (or DJ) creates a successful transaction as a result of their performance, then we link the transaction or affiliate-link-press to the performing artist (or DJ). The original artist receives maximum royalties, and the performing artist is then given a commission or virtual credit as incentive for creating the sale and playing great music.
</p>

<h3 id="section_title">Results</h3>
<p>We launched a fully functioning prototype to a test market and received great feedback. Unfortunately the cost to develop the entire system was far greater than our funding would allow. Overall, it was a great learning experience that paved the way for my design career. :)</p>
