"William is an extremely talented, focused, creative and disciplined designer. His approach utilizes the best practices and processes that are industry standards, yet he does not let those protocols throttle his creativity and delivery!" **-Xan Alexander - MyMelo CEO**

"...William is the consummate professional. If he says he'll have it for you tomorrow at 2:00 it'll be ready. No games, straight up pricing, 110% over-delivery. This is so rare for someone as artistic as William to have such a strong grasp of what most businesses crave from artistic individuals - professionalism and the ability to deliver. Absolutely stunning results and I'll be trying to stay on William's calendar well into the future."  **-Jay Everingham - Founder Fancliq**
