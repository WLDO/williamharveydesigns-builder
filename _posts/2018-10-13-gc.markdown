{% section_title Challenge %}
{% textalign left %}
Guitar Center proposed a challenge to create a mobile touch interface to accompany their hardware. The goal was to create a second layer of interaction, by utilizing the extra computation speed of the mobile device to add more play-ability with the hardware and improve on the existing Hardware interface by taking advantage of the touch interface.

{% section_title Solution %}
{% textalign left %}
Our solution for the touch interface was to ensure that the most important controls were always available and visible to the user within a single swipe, while still displaying access to the extra features so as not to be lost within the app. We also took advantage of the computing power by designing a teaching tool for the user to learn how to play drums. This provided that extra layer of functionality to the existing hardware.
