UI/UX/Graphic Design - Branding
{% endtextalign %}

{% section_title Challenge %}
{% textalign left %}
I was approached by a unique startup that was in the need of branding and a full web system design. The challenge for branding was to maintain a modern web presence that focused on Music Lovers and Radio Listeners, while maintaining a look of a leading music technology group.
The challenge for the web design was to re-engage radio station site visitors, and completely re-imagine the purpose of visiting a radio station website.

I was given full creative reign for the Logo creation, this allowed for unhindered imagination. We went back and fourth on Font Type and once the type was chosen, it was time to work on the logo's icon. And something magical happened... Allow me to introduce, The Melo Monster!! The mascot of MyMelo. This monster was born in a Franeknstien-esque fashion, everything came together rather naturally. I combined the middle 'M' with the traditional Radio Boombox, but once I added the dials for eyes, and a tuning bar for a tooth, he came to life!! I topped him off with a Widows Peak and the Monster really came out in him. The Melo Monster works great for every situation! He even gives the company speeches!

The primary goal was to focus on the music first, so I placed only the live-song info in the center of the screen and decided to leave everything else below the fold. The next goal was to exhibit the station branding and local identity, so I chose a background image that was minimal but familiar, as not to take up too much focus, but would still provide familiarity with the city, without having to focus your eyes onto the image.

The third priority was to keep the user engaged. So I designed a music explorer tool that would allow the user to dig deep into the music archive.
